   - Add the `Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>` header to all authenticated requests.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Handle common errors like `401 Unauthorized` and `403 Forbidden` to prompt the user for login or show an appropriate error message.

   - Provide meaningful feedback during the upload process.
